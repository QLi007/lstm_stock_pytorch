# Development Log

## Project Name: LSTM Stock Predictor with Kelly Criterion

### Date: 2023-03-25

#### Modifications
- Created the project structure using a PowerShell script
- Generated the core files for LSTM stock prediction model
- Set up the Kelly Criterion loss function for position sizing
- Implemented data loading and preprocessing functionality
- Created configuration and testing infrastructure

#### Test Results
- Project structure successfully created
- All files generated with correct encoding

#### Issues Encountered
- Initially had an issue with the PowerShell script missing a closing tag (`"@`) in the README.md section
- Fixed by adding the missing tag and running the script again

#### Solutions
- Added the missing terminator to the script
- Verified successful project creation

#### Follow-Up Plans
- Create sample data for testing
- Test the model training pipeline
- Implement model evaluation metrics
- Add visualization for model predictions

### Date: 2023-03-26

#### Modifications
- Added sample stock data CSV for testing
- Created proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
- Enhanced training script with command-line arguments and model saving capability
- Added model evaluation script with metrics and visualization
- Updated requirements.txt with matplotlib dependency
- Updated README with improved documentation and project structure

#### Issues Encountered
- Chinese characters in comments were displaying incorrectly due to encoding issues
- The `--dry-run` flag mentioned in CI/CD workflow was not implemented in the training script

#### Solutions
- Added `__init__.py` files to make the code structure a proper Python package
- Created sample data file for testing
- Implemented comprehensive evaluation script with metrics and visualization
- Added model saving functionality
- Implemented the `--dry-run` flag in the training script

#### Follow-Up Plans
- Add data splitting functionality to create proper train/validation/test sets
- Implement early stopping based on validation metrics
- Add hyperparameter tuning capability
- Create a model inference script for real-time predictions

### Date: 2023-03-27

#### Modifications
- Implemented comprehensive feature engineering with multiple technical indicators:
  - Multiple moving averages (5,10,20,34,60,120,200 days)
  - RSI with multiple periods
  - MACD components (MACD, signal, histogram)
  - Williams %R indicator
  - Volatility metrics
  - Volume indicators
- Added data normalization with options for standardization and min-max scaling
- Implemented rolling window approach to avoid lookahead bias in feature scaling
- Enhanced LSTM model with:
  - Attention mechanism to focus on important time steps
  - Bidirectional option for better context
  - Improved initialization for faster convergence
  - Batch normalization for stability
- Developed advanced loss functions:
  - TradingOptimizationLoss: optimizes for returns, drawdown, and smooth equity curve
  - KellyDrawdownLoss: combines Kelly criterion with drawdown and smoothness penalties
- Improved training workflow with:
  - Train/validation/test splitting
  - Early stopping and learning rate scheduling
  - Comprehensive logging
  - Model checkpointing
- Added future data leakage detection to ensure no lookahead bias
- Updated configuration with more control over feature selection and loss function parameters

#### Test Results
- Code structure review shows proper implementation of the required features
- Feature engineering module successfully generates all requested technical indicators
- Loss functions correctly incorporate the optimization goals (returns, drawdown, smoothness)

#### Issues Encountered
- Ensuring proper data splitting for time series (avoiding random shuffling)
- Implementing rolling window normalization without future information leakage
- Designing a loss function that balances multiple objectives (returns, drawdown, smoothness)

#### Solutions
- Used chronological splits for data instead of random shuffling
- Implemented advanced rolling window approach for normalization
- Added validation checks for future information leakage
- Created parameterized loss functions with configurable weights for different objectives

#### Follow-Up Plans
- Conduct backtesting on real market data
- Experiment with different combinations of technical indicators
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
- Add cross-validation for robustness
- Implement trading simulation with transaction costs
