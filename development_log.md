#### Additional Issues and Optimization Opportunities

1. **Memory Optimization Issues**:
   - The data loader keeps all datasets in memory which could be problematic for large datasets
   - Feature engineering creates multiple intermediate DataFrames that could be optimized
   - The rolling window normalization approach creates memory pressure

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - The `_check_future_leakage` function calculates correlation for every feature which is computationally expensive
   - The feature normalization with rolling windows for each feature is inefficient
   - The features are recalculated even if they already exist in cached datasets

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - More graceful handling needed when config file specifies features that don't exist in the dataset
   - Need better error messages when data doesn't contain required columns (open, high, low, close)
   - More robust handling of edge cases in feature calculation functions

4. **API and Usability Improvements**:
   - The StockDataLoader doesn't support incremental data loading for streaming scenarios
   - The baseline comparison code could use a more modular approach for adding new strategies
   - Configuration validation is minimal and doesn't catch many common errors

5. **Robustness Enhancements**:
   - The model evaluation doesn't test for robustness across different market conditions
   - The feature importance analysis doesn't account for feature collinearity
   - The hyperparameter tuning doesn't systematically explore the parameter space

#### Solutions

1. **Memory Optimization Solutions**:
   - Implement data generators instead of keeping all data in memory
   - Add incremental processing options for large datasets

   - Implement more efficient correlation calculations in `_check_future_leakage`

   - Optimize the feature normalization process to be more computationally efficient

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**:
   - Add configuration validation to check for missing or invalid parameters
   - Implement more informative error messages throughout the codebase
   - Add data validation checks before processing to catch issues early

4. **API and Usability Enhancements**:
   - Create a more modular strategy framework for easier addition of new strategies
